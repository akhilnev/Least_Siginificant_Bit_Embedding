# Least_Siginificant_Bit_Embedding
The project is used to embed a binary message into a greyscale image in the form of a 2D matrix which can be chosen by the user. We use LSB and LSB+- embedding in the project which are two alike but different methods. LSB+- method has an extra key/password field with a more efficient algorithm.
